avr-ppm-memory-switch-with-radar-pwm
====================================

An experimental (not production stable) R/C memory switch based on ATTiny 13A.

The memory switch provides two channels that can be turned on or off with one
R/C (PPM) channel. Additionally, it provides a PWM, which may be used to drive
a small gear motor of a radar on a model boat.

This code is only intended to be used for educational purposes.
It is not production stable and must under no circumstance be used in any kind of radio controlled machinery, e.g., planes, cars, boats, etc.
