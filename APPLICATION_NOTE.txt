Place C1 very close to the VCC and GND pins of the µC.

The reset line has an internal pull-up resistor, but if the environment is noisy, as it is in a R/C model, it can be insufficient and resets can occur sporadically.

If you want to update the program although the micro controller sticks on a breadboard/protoboard (in-circuit programming), it is necessary to allow entering both, the programming mode and the ordinary low level reset. This can be achieved by applying an external pull-up resistor to the RESET line. This pull-up resistor makes sure that the RESET line does not go low unintended. The pull-up should not be so strong that the programmer cannot trigger a reset by drawing the RESET line to low. Refer to the datasheet for the value of the pull-up resistor on specific devices.

The pull-up resistor R4 works perfectly with the AVR ISP MKII programmer. The capacitator C2 is only necessary if you are still observing unintended resets.

All output pins are switching VCC to GND. Hence, the connector X1 provides a common VCC.
